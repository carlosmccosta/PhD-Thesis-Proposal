\section{Context}

Automation of repetitive assembly tasks has revolutionized the manufacturing of products for a long time. However, these systems are usually programmed for very specific assignments and require expensive reprogramming to perform different assembly operations. With the arrival of more cooperative and flexible robotic arm designs, this industrial trend is changing and a significant amount of jobs that are currently being performed by humans due to its assembly complexity or cognitive requirements are now being transitioned to hybrid cooperative systems \cite{Surdilovic2010} and in the future they might even become fully automated. These promising industrial applications lead to the creation of several research projects such as Saphari\footnote{\url{http://www.saphari.eu/}}, Rosetta\footnote{\url{http://www.fp7rosetta.org/}}, JAHIR\footnote{\url{http://www6.in.tum.de/Main/ResearchJahir}}, Charm\footnote{\url{http://charm.stanford.edu/}}, RoboEarth\footnote{\url{http://roboearth.org/}}, KnowRob\footnote{\url{http://www.knowrob.org/}}, ROS-Industrial\footnote{\url{http://rosindustrial.org/}} (among many others).
