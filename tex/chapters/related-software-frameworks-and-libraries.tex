\section*{}

Cooperative assembly of objects by robots is a multidisciplinary problem that requires advanced computer software systems. In order to speed up the implementation and deployment of the assembly system, several frameworks and libraries will be used. Among the most important are the \gls{ros} for the system architecture, Gazebo for simulation and testing, \gls{opencv} / \gls{pcl} for 2D / 3D perception and the RoboEarth / RoboHow projects software for robotics cognition.




\section{Software frameworks}

\subsection{\glsentrytext{ros}}

	\caption{\glsentrytext{ros} logo}

\end{wrapfigure}

\gls{ros}\footnote{\url{http://www.ros.org}} \cite{Quigley2009} is a software framework designed to ease the development of robot systems. It provides seamless integration between hardware drivers and software modules, allowing a fast transition between simulation and deployment. It's an open source project that offers a distributed computing framework with several core libraries and development tools that aims to speedup software prototyping, testing and deployment.

The \gls{ros} architecture was designed from the beginning to be a distributed peer-to-peer software framework that could be deployed in several operating systems and implemented in a range of different programming languages. However, given that most of the \gls{ros} community prefers open source software, the Ubuntu\footnote{\url{http://www.ubuntu.com}} operating system is the main developing and testing environment, and as such, the recommended choice for \gls{ros} developers. Moreover, considering that robotics research requires software with both performance and maintainability at its core, the C++\footnote{\url{http://www.cplusplus.com}} programming language is used in most of the available packages, along with Python\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org}} and Java\footnote{\url{https://www.java.com}}.

Being a distributed computing framework, \gls{ros} relies in network connections and exchange of messages to perform the intended tasks. As such, its architecture was developed to follow a publish / subscribe pattern (\gls{ros} topics\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/Topics}}) and request and reply communication paradigm (\gls{ros} services\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/Services}} and actions\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/actionlib}}). This allows \gls{ros} nodes\footnote{\url{http://wiki.ros.org/Nodes}} (operating system processes) to be deployed in different computing platforms with ease and simplifies testing and exchange of software modules.
