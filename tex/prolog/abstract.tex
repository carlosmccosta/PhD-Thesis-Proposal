\chapter*{Abstract}

Automation of simple and repetitive tasks using robots has revolutionized industrial manufacturing over the years, allowing to improve the product quality while also reducing the overall production costs. In the past this was mostly achieved with teach pendant programming and more recently by means of lead-through programming. The development of new sensors and the significant increase in computation capabilities opened new possibilities regarding the fast repurposing of robotic systems for small batch production and mass customization of products, which increased the demand for flexible robotic systems capable of being easily re-programmed by non-technical personal.

Automation of complex assembly structures is one the most challenging tasks concerning industrial manufacturing, which requires multidisciplinary knowledge and high level of precision. This thesis proposal aims to provide an intuitive and easy to use robot assembly system capable of automatically plan the assembly / disassembly sequence by analyzing the fully assembled \gls{cad} model while also providing an immersive augmented reality interface for coordinate tasks between robotic arms and operators. This cooperative approach allows to improve the overall productivity of the assembly line by relying on the robot's precision / speed capabilities and on the human knowledge / dexterity for quickly and robustly perform the required operations.
