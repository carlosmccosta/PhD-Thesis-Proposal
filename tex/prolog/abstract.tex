\chapter*{Abstract}

Automation of simple and repetitive tasks using robots has revolutionized industrial manufacturing over the years, allowing to improve overall productivity while also reducing productions costs. In the past this was mostly achieved with teach pendant programming and more recently by means of lead through programming. The development of new sensors and the significant increase in computation capabilities opened new possibilities regarding the automation of more complex tasks, which increased the need for flexible robotic systems, capable of being easily re-programmed by non-technical personal.

Automation of complex assembly structures is one the most challenging task concerning industrial manufacturing, which requires multidisciplinary knowledge and high level of precision. This thesis aims to provide an intuitive, immersive and easy to use robot assembly system capable of learning new assembly skills through demonstration and also be able to cooperate with humans in complex tasks in order to improve overall productivity by relying on the robot's precision / speed skills and on the human knowledge / dexterity. The combination of pre-existing knowledge (\gls{cad}, \glspl{sop}) with object localization and semantic interpretation of the operator movements will allow the definition of reusable assembly operations. Moreover, to improve the human-robot interaction, an immersive interface using augmented reality will provide a fast and intuitive way to exchange knowledge and improve the cooperation between the assembly system and the human operator.
