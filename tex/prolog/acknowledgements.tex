\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors and the INESC team, for their helpful contributions. Their experience and expertise significantly improved the quality of this PhD proposal.

I am also very grateful for the knowledge and experiences that I gather from my friends, teachers and colleagues over the years.

And of course, to my family, for their continuous support.
